> Different from 2D images that have a dominant representation as pixel arrays, 3D data has multiple popular representations, such as point cloud, mesh, volumetric field, multi-view images and parametric models.  So far, I feel parametric models get the least attention in ML.  I am not sure if this is true for both academic group and industrial group.
